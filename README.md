# Mappers Toolkit

## Overview

Mappers Toolkit aims to consolidate a wide variety of useful, modular mapping tools
into a single web-app, where many functions can be quickly performed and interacted with
on a single, unified map.

## Setup

The app is built on top of the following stack:

- `vite`: build tooling,
- `eslint`: code linting,
- `dprint`: code formatting,
- `tailwindcss`: CSS framework.

The following commands are provided:

- `npm run dev`: start the local web development server.
- `npm run format`: execute dprint on the source code.
- `npm run lint`: lint the source code.
- `npm run build`: build the webapp.
- `npm run preview`: preview the production build of the webapp.
